                I was born in Ecuador and moved to the United States when I was really young. I came here with my family and focused on getting an education, going to college, and graduating with a degree that would allow me to live a comfortably lifestyle, while also providing for my family.

            <div class="div-2">
                I have a passion for music, movies, video games, and computers. Though I've been using computers my entire life, it was only recently that I decided to take the next steps into what I hope would become my new career.

            <div class="div-3">
                A fun fact about me is that I have a street in Ecuador named after my family. I also collect mechanical keyboards, and have a pittie named Zoe that I love and cherish.
